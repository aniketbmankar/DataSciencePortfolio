For this DoorDash project, I was hired to improve the company's marketing strategies. The objective of this data analytics project was to analyze the purchase behaviors of customers following a marketing campaign. The goal was to gain insights into the spending habits of DoorDash customers and use this information to inform future marketing efforts.

The data set utilized in the article did not originate from DoorDash. Instead, it was sourced from Avery Smith's Data Career Jumpstart Bootcamp and made available for educational purposes.

This data set was derived from a real-life case study about iFood, which is a food delivery service in Brazil. DoorDash was mentioned in this article due to its popularity in the United States. The data has 2,206 rows and is accessed via the provided link on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data.
