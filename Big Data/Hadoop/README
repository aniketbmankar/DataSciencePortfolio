#Problem statement 

Being the fleet manager for the AZ national trucking (ANT), a fictional national trucking corporation, we are responsible to minimize risk and ensure that all the drivers follow the rules and regulations of the corporation and do not present any insurance risk.
Identify the risky drivers from dataset analysis depending on various factors like geolocation, vehicles, average miles, events and risk factors.

#Objective

The Objective is to determine dangerous commercial truck drivers nationwide by using:
Hadoop tools and techniques to process and analyze the dataset by creating visualizations in Tableau
Using the truck fleet data to analyze trucking movement to meet the organization's goal of understanding risk.
Analyzing the risk factor using model and events.
